# When to Research (DEPRECATED)

This reference has been consolidated into the `rrr-debugger` agent.

**Location:** `agents/rrr-debugger.md`

**Section:** `<research_vs_reasoning>`

**Reason:** Debugging expertise is now baked into the agent. Loading separate reference files into orchestrator context was wasteful (~95% context reduction).

See `agents/rrr-debugger.md` for the consolidated debugging methodology.
